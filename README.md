# 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of various fundamental machine learning algorithms. The algorithms are implemented in Python and include both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The goal of this project is to showcase the practical implementation and usage of these algorithms for various machine learning tasks.

## 📊 Algorithms Included:

1. **K-Means Clustering** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑  
   An unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering data into distinct groups based on similarity.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** 🔍  
   A supervised classification algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their neighbors.

3. **Naive Bayes** 📈  
   A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem, commonly used for text classification and spam filtering.

4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** 📉  
   A dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the number of features while retaining the most significant information in the data.

5. **Random Forest** 🌳  
   An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and combines their predictions for classification or regression tasks.

6. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** 🛠️  
   A supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes.

7. **Decision Tree** 🌲  
   A tree-like model used for both classification and regression tasks. It splits data into subsets based on feature values, leading to decisions.

8. **Logistic Regression** ➗  
   A statistical model used for binary classification tasks by estimating probabilities using the logistic function.

9. **Simple Linear Regression** 📏  
   A regression technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable using a straight line.

## 🚀 Usage

Each algorithm has its own Python file, which can be run independently. To use any algorithm:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired algorithm directory and run the Python file:
   ```bash
   cd <algorithm-directory>
   python <algorithm-file>.py
   ```

## 📋 Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the algorithms:

- `numpy` ➕
- `pandas` 🐼
- `scikit-learn` ⚙️
